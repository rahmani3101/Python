## 📚 Prerequisites

- Python 3.x  
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)  
- Recommended: create a virtual environment  
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
  venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows


## 🚀 Quick Start

    Clone this repository
'''bash
git clone https://github.com/rahmani3101/Python_practise.git
cd Python_practise

Activate your virtual environment (if used).

Launch notebooks:

    jupyter lab

    Open any .ipynb file in the browser and explore.

⭐ Goals

    Learn Python fundamentals: data structures, functions, string processing, loops, lambdas, time/date handling.

    Hands-on practice through self-contained Jupyter notebooks.

    Build foundational knowledge for data science, web dev, or automation.

🔄 Contributions

    Contributions via issues, suggestions, or notebook additions are welcome!

    For new exercises:

        Create a new .ipynb file.

        Use clear commentary and examples.

### 🔧 Tips & Enhancements

- **Add a Setup Script**: Consider including a `requirements.txt` for dependencies like `jupyter`, `numpy`, or `pandas`.
- **Visuals**: You could embed screenshots or example outputs from notebooks.
- **License & Badges**: Link to your preferred license and add CI/testing badges if you incorporate tests later.

Let me know if you’d like help customizing it further—like adding environment files, examples, or CI badges!
